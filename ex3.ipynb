    "Newtonian gravity only works for relatively weak gravitational fields, but Einsteins theory of General Relativity (GR) gives a more complete description of gravity. However, when the gravitational field is sufficiently weak and all relevant bodies move with velocities much less than the speed of light, the gravitational force predicted from GR reduces to the familiar \"inverse square law\" Ã  la Newton. Taking into account the first order correction from GR to the Newtonian gravitational potential, the gravitational potential energy can be written as\n",

    "where $\\alpha$ has units of length and typically is very small compared to other distances related to planetary systems ($\\alpha$ can be expressed through the speed of light, the eccentricity of orbit, mass of the Sun and similar parameters). \n",

    "For all planets in our solar system except for Mercury, the corrections from General Relativity can be safely neglected. The effect is also extremely small for Mercury, but it does give a measurable. The effect is known as the *Mercury perihelion shift*, and was one of the first experimental confirmations of General Relativity. After each revolution, the perihelion of the orbit (i.e. the point of closest to the sum) is slightly shifted by an angle $\\Delta \\theta$. For Mercury, $\\alpha^2 \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{-8} \\mbox{AU}^2$ which gives $\\alpha \\approx 10^{-4}\\mbox{AU} $. As long as the distance between Mercury and the Sun is much larger than $\\alpha$, we need not to worry about higher order corrections.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Starting from the class Planet you created in Exercise 2, create a class PlanetGR (see outline below - if you wish to use it) in which the constructior takes $\\alpha^2$ as an additional argument. Modify the doTimeStep function such that it includes the first order correction from General Relativity. \n",

    "With $\\alpha^2 \\approx 1.1 \\times 10^{-8} \\mbox{AU}^2$, we would have to wait way too long until we directly can see the perihelion shift with our program. Instead, we'll study the perhelion shift of Mercury as a function of $\\alpha^2$ for larger $\\alpha^2$ and then reduce $\\alpha^2$ so that we can eventually extrapolate the relation for $\\alpha^2 = 1.1 \\cdot 10^{-8}\\mbox{AU}^2$. \n",

Use the initial conditios $x=0.47$ AU, $y=0$, $v_x=0$ and $v_y = 8.2 $ AU/year. This will put Mercury in the aphelion (point furthest away from the Sun) at $t=0$.
